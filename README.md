# Raging Lunatics 2020

Welcome to the Raging Lunatics repository for the reproducible research assignment for the course Reinforcement Learning at the University of Amsterdam, by Anna Langedijk, Christiaan van der Vlist, David ÄŒerny. Here you will find the most recent codebase, progress and schedules.

## Schedules

In this section you will find an overview of schedules, agreements and TO-DOs

### Schedule Week 5 (28-09 - 04-10)

* [ ] Find environments
  * [ ] Standard environments (mountain car, gridworld, windy gridworld)
  * [ ] Baird's Counterexample (known to diverge)
* [ ] Tell the story of which environments we have tried, and for which reasons we assumed, based on our experiences, that this one would potentially diverge.

### Schedule Week 6 (05-10 - 11-10)

* [ ] Make DQN code general such that we can work with it
* [ ] Detail our quest for environments and generate results
* [ ] Do a first batch of **experiments** so we ensure we have something ready for the Feedback Session at 12-10:
  * [ ] Do they logically follow? In case we get (unexpected) results, explain our thought process of why this happened and theorize why we decided to do certain follow-up experiments.
  * [ ] Ablation type studies
    * [ ] Do experience replay
    * [ ] Combine experience replay with target networks
* [ ] Make sure we write up a good first draft so we get proper feedback
